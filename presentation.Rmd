## What is ggplot?

The grammar of graphics is an idea that plots are assembled in layers, and each layer does something different. 

That means you make your graph through a series of independent actions: 

1. Create the plot and assign the axes 
2. Build a geometric object from your data
3. Map variables as different aesthetics

## How does it work?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif)

But really,

```{r data, eval = F}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) +
    geoms() +
    coordinates() +
    facets()
```

With these layers you can make *any* type of plot.


## Aesthetic mappings 

```{r aes, eval = F}
ggplot(data, MAPPING = AES(...)) +
    geoms() +
    coordinates() +
    facets()
```

Essentially, any time there is a variable that you want to look at, put it in the mappings. This is where you tell ggplot what the x and y variables are, in addition to any other variables that you want to explore. 

You can also change what variables are being mapped *within* layers... we’ll get back to that though.

## For example - colors {.smaller}

In this scatterplot we're mapping carat to x, price to y, and cut to color:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, col = cut)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Geom functions

```{r geom, eval = F}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) +
    GEOMS() +
    coordinates() +
    facets()
```


The type of plot that you want to make (histogram, scatterplot, area map, density curve, etc.) is determined by the geom function that you use. 

## For example - 3 diamonds & a map

```{r geom_ex, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, col = cut)) +
    geom_point()

p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
    geom_density()

usa <- map_data("usa")

p3 <- ggplot(usa, aes(long, lat, group = group)) + 
    geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black")

p4 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
    geom_boxplot()

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = list(p1, p2, p3, p4))
```

## Stat transformations

```{r stat, eval = F}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) +
    geoms(STAT) +
    coordinates() +
    facets()
```
Statistical transformations and geoms can generally be interchangeable.

They refer to the changes that you have to make to your data to use it in your plot. 

## `geom_bar()` vs. `geom_col()`

What's the difference between a histogram and a bar chart? 

* In math: histogram != bar chart

* In ggplot: geom_histogram == geom_bar

```{r hist, echo=t}
?geom_histogram
```

You'll see that the documentation states: "`geom_histogram` is an alias for `geom_bar` plus `stat_bin`." 

## What? {.smaller}

`geom_bar` creates a histogram, a bar chart where the heights of the bars represents the number of cases in each group.

```{r stat_ex, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## `stat_count`

To create this plot, ggplot has to first count the number of diamonds that fall into each category of cut - that's what `stat_count` does.

Essentially it creates a new variable, "count":

```{r stat_ex2, echo=FALSE}
count_df <- data.frame(
  cut = c("Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Premium", "Ideal"),
  count = c(1610, 4906, 12082, 13791, 21551),
  prop = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
)
count_df
```

## So what about `geom_col()`? {.smaller}

`geom_col()` creates a bar chart where the heights of the bars represents the values of the data, or the `stat_identity`.

```{r, stat_ex3}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
    geom_col()
```

## Why are you showing us this?

TLDR;

* `geom_bar()` creates histograms based on the `stat_count` transformation

* `geom_col()` creates bar charts based on the `stat_identity` transformation

* This illustrates how stats work within geoms and how they can be relatively interchangeable 

## Postitions

```{r pos, eval=F}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) +
    geoms(POSITION) +
    coordinates() +
    facets()
```

Position adjustments refer to ways to adjust the location or orientation of your data.

One way to deal with overplotting points is to add some jitter, or a little bit of randomness.

## For example - jitter {.smaller}

```{r jitter1}
ggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point()
```


## `position = "jitter"` {.smaller}

Now you can see there's some randomness to the position of each point.
```{r jitter2}
ggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

## Coordinate functions

```{r coord, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) +
    geoms() +
    COORDINATES() +
    facets()
```

We're all used to Cartesian systems, but you can change your coordinate system to flip your x & y axis', make a pie chart, draw a map, and do a number of other things. 

## For example - coxcombs {.smaller}

Turn this:
```{r bar}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## Coxcomb charts {.smaller}

Into this:
```{r cox}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_polar()
```

## Facet functions

```{r facet, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes(...)) +
    geoms() +
    coordinates() +
    FACETS()
```

Facet function let you split your plot into subplots, or facets,  that each display one subset of the data. This is particularly useful for categorical variables.

## For example - facet wrap {.smaller}

The same histogram of price, broken down into subplots based on cut. 

```{r facet_ex}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000) +
    facet_wrap(~cut)
```



## Back to aesthetics...

```{r aes_again, eval = F}
ggplot(data, MAPPING = AES(...)) +
    geoms() +
    coordinates() +
    facets()
```

Mappings can be applied to *each* layer *individually*. 

The mappings inside of a function are applied *to that layer only*, so it is possible to display different aesthetics *and data* in different layers.

## Where to begin?

```{r ally, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(GGally)
```


`ggpairs()` is a function from the `GGally` package that does two helpful things:

* provides two different comparisons of each pair of columns 

* displays either the density or count of the respective variable along the diagonal


## What does it look like?
```{r pairs, message=FALSE}
small_diamonds <- sample_n(diamonds, 1000)

small_diamonds <- small_diamonds[c("carat", "cut", "color", "clarity", "depth", "price")]
ggpairs(small_diamonds, columns = c(1:6))
```

## cut vs. carat & price

Let's look a little closer:

```{r bee, echo=FALSE}
cowplot::plot_grid(
    ggplot(small_diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .5),
    ggplot(small_diamonds, aes(cut, price)) +
    geom_quasirandom(alpha = .1)
)
```

## So what?

So from this quick exploratory data analysis using only two plots we can see that people are willig to pay more $ for bigger, not higher quality, diamonds. We can also see that more diamonds are classified as having an "ideal" cut. Hmm...

## ggplot extensions

There are many other extensions to ggplot that you can use to enhance your plots and take them to the next level. 

Check out www.ggplot2-exts.org for a list of them. 


## gganimate

gganimate can animate your plots to show how values change over time. It's still in development, so it's not playing nicely with my computer at the moment:

https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate

## That's all folks!
